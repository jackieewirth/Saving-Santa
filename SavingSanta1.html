		<h1>SAVING SANTA</h1>
	<div id="page0" style="display: block;">
		WE NEED YOUR HELP! Santa has been kidnapped with only two days until Christmas!<br>
	Santa has been missing for two days; a note was found in his home stating: <br>
	"There will be no Christmas this year if I can not work for Santa in his workshop - <br>
	good luck trying to save Christmas, you'll need it!" The letter was signed by Cookie, <br>
	an elf who had just recently been fired from Santa's workshop for constantly eating on <br>
	the job. We know that Santa is somewhere inside of the Workshop. It is up to YOU, as Santa's <br>
	first-hand man, to find Santa and save him in time for Christmas! <br>
